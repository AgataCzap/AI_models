# AI_models
This depository is for demonstration purposes, for any potential employer, I'm showcasing here various AI model types that I learned to write.

These models are from:

- Francois Chollet's book 'Deep Learning with Python language & Keras library'
- Udemy Artificial Intelligence Tensorflow Course
- Codecademy Artificial Intelligence with Tensorflow Course 

All of these projects demonstrate that I am capable of using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras and Tensorflow Python libraries.
