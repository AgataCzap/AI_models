# AI_models
This depository is a combination of demonstration code from AI courses I had undertaken, as well as my own AI models (in the near future).

Some of these models are from:

- Francois Chollet's book 'Deep Learning with Python language & Keras library'
- Udemy Course: coming soon

The course models are only for demonstration purposes of my understanding of AI code & theory, I do not take credit for them.
Every author of the code is credit at every relevant page.

List of my own AI models:
