# AI_models
This depository is a combination of demonstration code from AI courses I had undertaken, as well as my own AI models (in the near future).

Some of these models are from:

- Francois Chollet's book 'Deep Learning with Python language & Keras library'
- Udemy Course: Finished, notebooks have been uploaded

The course models are only for demonstration purposes of my understanding of AI code & theory, I do not take credit for them.
Every author of the code is credited at every relevant page.

List of my own AI models:
CNN multiclass classification model for dog breeds
RNN model for AI4Code, past Kaggle competition, LMM building practice
